# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Real-time Fraud Alerting System is a critical component that provides immediate notifications when fraudulent activities are detected. This system will enable businesses to respond quickly to potential fraud, reducing financial losses and improving customer trust. The alerting system will support multiple notification channels, configurable thresholds, and intelligent alert routing to ensure the right people are notified at the right time with the right level of urgency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fraud analyst, I want to receive real-time alerts when high-risk transactions are detected, so that I can investigate and take immediate action to prevent fraud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction receives a fraud score above the configured high-risk threshold THEN the system SHALL generate an immediate alert within 5 seconds
2. WHEN an alert is generated THEN the system SHALL include transaction details, fraud score, risk factors, and recommended actions
3. WHEN multiple high-risk transactions occur from the same user within 10 minutes THEN the system SHALL consolidate alerts to prevent notification spam
4. IF the fraud score exceeds 90% THEN the system SHALL escalate the alert to senior analysts and managers
5. WHEN an alert is acknowledged by an analyst THEN the system SHALL update the alert status and stop sending duplicate notifications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to configure custom alert rules and thresholds, so that I can tailor the alerting system to my business's specific risk tolerance and operational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the alert configuration interface THEN the system SHALL allow setting custom fraud score thresholds for low, medium, and high-risk alerts
2. WHEN configuring alert rules THEN the system SHALL support conditions based on transaction amount, user behavior patterns, geographic location, and time-based factors
3. WHEN creating alert rules THEN the system SHALL allow specifying different notification channels for different risk levels
4. IF invalid threshold values are entered THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent saving
5. WHEN alert rules are modified THEN the system SHALL apply changes to new transactions within 30 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to receive alerts through multiple channels (email, SMS, Slack, webhook), so that I can ensure critical fraud notifications reach me regardless of my current communication preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring notification preferences THEN the system SHALL support email, SMS, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and webhook notifications
2. WHEN an alert is triggered THEN the system SHALL deliver notifications through all configured channels for that alert level
3. WHEN a notification fails to deliver THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
4. IF all delivery attempts fail THEN the system SHALL log the failure and escalate through alternative channels
5. WHEN webhook notifications are configured THEN the system SHALL include authentication headers and retry failed deliveries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor alert system performance and delivery metrics, so that I can ensure the alerting system is functioning reliably and optimize its performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the alert dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time metrics including alert volume, delivery success rates, and response times
2. WHEN viewing alert history THEN the system SHALL show alert trends, peak times, and false positive rates
3. WHEN an alert delivery fails THEN the system SHALL track failure reasons and provide detailed error logs
4. IF alert volume exceeds normal thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate system health alerts to administrators
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide exportable analytics on alert effectiveness and team response times

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a fraud analyst, I want to receive contextual information with each alert, so that I can quickly assess the situation and make informed decisions without switching between multiple systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an alert is generated THEN the system SHALL include user profile summary, recent transaction history, and device fingerprint information
2. WHEN displaying alert details THEN the system SHALL show risk factor breakdown explaining why the transaction was flagged
3. WHEN an alert involves a repeat offender THEN the system SHALL highlight previous fraud cases and patterns
4. IF geographic anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL include location-based risk indicators and travel feasibility analysis
5. WHEN presenting recommendations THEN the system SHALL suggest specific actions based on the fraud type and risk level

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a customer support representative, I want to receive alerts for customer-impacting fraud prevention actions, so that I can proactively reach out to legitimate customers whose transactions may have been blocked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is automatically blocked due to fraud detection THEN the system SHALL generate a customer service alert within 2 minutes
2. WHEN generating customer service alerts THEN the system SHALL include customer contact information and suggested communication templates
3. WHEN a customer calls about a blocked transaction THEN support representatives SHALL have access to the fraud alert context and resolution options
4. IF a blocked transaction is later determined to be legitimate THEN the system SHALL update the customer's risk profile and alert preferences
5. WHEN resolving false positive cases THEN the system SHALL provide feedback to improve future fraud detection accuracy

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security team member, I want to receive aggregated threat intelligence alerts, so that I can identify coordinated fraud attacks and emerging threat patterns across the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple related fraud attempts are detected THEN the system SHALL generate threat pattern alerts highlighting potential coordinated attacks
2. WHEN analyzing fraud patterns THEN the system SHALL identify common indicators such as shared IP addresses, device fingerprints, or behavioral patterns
3. WHEN threat intelligence is updated THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust alert sensitivity for known attack vectors
4. IF a new fraud pattern emerges THEN the system SHALL create adaptive rules and notify security teams of the new threat
5. WHEN generating threat reports THEN the system SHALL provide actionable intelligence for updating fraud prevention strategies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to configure alert escalation workflows, so that critical fraud incidents are automatically escalated to appropriate personnel based on severity and business impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring escalation rules THEN the system SHALL support multi-level escalation based on alert severity, business hours, and team availability
2. WHEN an alert is not acknowledged within the specified timeframe THEN the system SHALL automatically escalate to the next level
3. WHEN escalating alerts THEN the system SHALL notify higher-level personnel while maintaining context from previous notifications
4. IF critical alerts occur outside business hours THEN the system SHALL follow after-hours escalation procedures and contact on-call personnel
5. WHEN escalation workflows are triggered THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail of all notification attempts and acknowledgments
